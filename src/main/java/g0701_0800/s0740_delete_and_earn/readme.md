## 740\. Delete and Earn

Medium

You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

*   Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and **every** element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.

Return _the **maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,4,2]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** You can perform the following operations: 

- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2]. 

- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = []. 
  
You earn a total of 6 points.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** You can perform the following operations: 

- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3]. 

- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3]. 

- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = []. 
  
You earn a total of 9 points.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        int[] sum = new int[10001];
        int min = 10001;
        int max = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum[num] += num;
            min = Math.min(num, min);
            max = Math.max(num, max);
        }

        int[] dp = new int[max + 1];
        dp[min] = sum[min];
        for (int i = min + 1; i <= max; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + sum[i]);
        }
        return dp[max];
    }
}
