## 2110\. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock

Medium

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.

A **smooth descent period** of a stock consists of **one or more contiguous** days such that the price on each day is **lower** than the price on the **preceding day** by **exactly** `1`. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return _the number of **smooth descent periods**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [3,2,1,4]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:** There are 7 smooth descent periods: 

[3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1] 

Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [8,6,7,7]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7] 

Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 â‰  1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = [1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

## Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    public long getDescentPeriods(int[] prices) {
        long descendantCount = 0;
        int previousCounts = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length - 1; i++) {
            if (prices[i] - prices[i + 1] == 1) {
                descendantCount++;
                if (previousCounts > 0) {
                    descendantCount += previousCounts;
                }
                previousCounts++;
            } else {
                previousCounts = 0;
            }
        }
        descendantCount += prices.length;
        return descendantCount;
    }
}
```
