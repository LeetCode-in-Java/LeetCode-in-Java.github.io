## 63\. Unique Paths II

Medium

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to <code>2 * 10<sup>9</sup></code>.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg)

**Input:** obstacleGrid = \[\[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above. There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner: 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right 

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg)

**Input:** obstacleGrid = \[\[0,1],[0,0]]

**Output:** 1 

**Constraints:**

*   `m == obstacleGrid.length`
*   `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
*   `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

## Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        // if start point has obstacle, there's no path
        if (obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        obstacleGrid[0][0] = 1;
        int m = obstacleGrid.length;
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1) {
                obstacleGrid[i][0] = 0;
            } else {
                obstacleGrid[i][0] = obstacleGrid[i - 1][0];
            }
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[0][j] == 1) {
                obstacleGrid[0][j] = 0;
            } else {
                obstacleGrid[0][j] = obstacleGrid[0][j - 1];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) {
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = 0;
                } else {
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i - 1][j] + obstacleGrid[i][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return obstacleGrid[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
