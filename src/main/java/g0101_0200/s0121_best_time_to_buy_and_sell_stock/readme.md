## 121\. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Easy

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0. 

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        int min = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > min) {
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - min);
            } else {
                min = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```
