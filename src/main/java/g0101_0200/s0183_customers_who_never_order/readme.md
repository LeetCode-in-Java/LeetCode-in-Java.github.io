## 183\. Customers Who Never Order

Easy

SQL Schema

Table: `Customers`

    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | id          | int     |
    | name        | varchar |
    +-------------+---------+
    id is the primary key column for this table.
    Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer. 

Table: `Orders`

    +-------------+------+
    | Column Name | Type |
    +-------------+------+
    | id          | int  |
    | customerId  | int  |
    +-------------+------+
    id is the primary key column for this table.
    customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
    Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it. 

Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

    Customers table:
    +----+-------+
    | id | name  |
    +----+-------+
    | 1  | Joe   |
    | 2  | Henry |
    | 3  | Sam   |
    | 4  | Max   |
    +----+-------+

    Orders table:
    +----+------------+
    | id | customerId |
    +----+------------+
    | 1  | 3          |
    | 2  | 1          |
    +----+------------+

**Output:**

    +-----------+
    | Customers |
    +-----------+
    | Henry     |
    | Max       |
    +-----------+

## Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT c.Name as Customers 
FROM Customers as c
LEFT JOIN Orders as o
ON c.Id = o.CustomerId  
WHERE o.CustomerId is null
```
