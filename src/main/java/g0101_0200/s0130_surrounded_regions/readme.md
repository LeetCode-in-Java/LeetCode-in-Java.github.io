## 130\. Surrounded Regions

Medium

You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing **letters** `'X'` and `'O'`, **capture regions** that are **surrounded**:

*   **Connect**: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
*   **Region**: To form a region **connect every** `'O'` cell.
*   **Surround**: The region is surrounded with `'X'` cells if you can **connect the region** with `'X'` cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the `board`.

To capture a **surrounded region**, replace all `'O'`s with `'X'`s **in-place** within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

**Output:** [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg)

In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\["X"]]

**Output:** [["X"]]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

## Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        // Edge case, empty grid
        if (board.length == 0) {
            return;
        }
        // Traverse first and last rows ( boundaries)
        for (int i = 0; i < board[0].length; i++) {
            // first row
            if (board[0][i] == 'O') {
                // It will covert O and all it's touching O's to #
                dfs(board, 0, i);
            }
            // last row
            if (board[board.length - 1][i] == 'O') {
                // Coverts O's to #'s (same thing as above)
                dfs(board, board.length - 1, i);
            }
        }
        // Traverse first and last Column (boundaries)
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            // first Column
            if (board[i][0] == 'O') {
                // Converts O's to #'s
                dfs(board, i, 0);
            }
            // last Column
            if (board[i][board[0].length - 1] == 'O') {
                // Coverts O's to #'s
                dfs(board, i, board[0].length - 1);
            }
        }
        // Traverse through entire matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O') {
                    // Convert O's to X's
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                }
                if (board[i][j] == '#') {
                    // Convert #'s to O's
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                }
            }
        }
    }

    void dfs(char[][] board, int row, int column) {
        if (row < 0
                || row >= board.length
                || column < 0
                || column >= board[0].length
                || board[row][column] != 'O') {
            return;
        }
        board[row][column] = '#';
        dfs(board, row + 1, column);
        dfs(board, row - 1, column);
        dfs(board, row, column + 1);
        dfs(board, row, column - 1);
    }
}
